<h2>Fuck Self-help</h2>
<p>
  I’m going to stop reading self-help books and listening to self-help podcasts. It’s been an addiction. The point of self-improvement is in the name. But I’ve noticed that I haven’t been improving much lately. There comes a point in self-improvement where the returns start to diminish.
</p>

<p>
  I would read to feel motivated and inspired, but it was like porn to me, or a drug. You know how a lot of people just use porn or drugs to distract themselves from living?
</p>
<p>
  That’s what I was like, but with self-help.
</p>
<p>
  I would get that “high” from reading a particularly profound quote or article, but I wouldn’t even apply it to my life. It was just another dopamine hit. I wasn’t doing anything worthwhile with any of the information I was soaking in.
</p>
<p>
  I would ooh and aah at every empowering quote and tell myself how I cannot wait to recite that over and over, and use it one day when I’m in a rut.
</p>
<p>
  I read every “How to maximize your productivity on Monday” article. I watched every motivational video with a clickbaity title like “Watch This and Change Your Life.”
</p>
<p>
  And yet, I don’t get nearly as much done as I want to. I spend so much fucking time learning about how to improve that it prevents me from going out and actually doing shit.
</p>
<p>
  I just kept looking for newness. For novelty. Something exciting.
</p>
<p>
  But it wouldn’t ever last. It never does.
</p>
<p>
  I always knew that this was a problem, but it hit me hard yesterday. I learned the origin of the word “inspire.” It means “to breathe.”
</p>
<p>
  I’m supposed to breathe in the inspiration, and then breathe it out.
</p>
<p>
  I have to use inspiration for good and create things with it. Yeah, it’s obvious, I know. But I never did that. I was breathing in all the inspiration and just holding it in until I passed out, doing nothing with it.
</p>
<p>
  Self-improvement is good though. To a point. After that it is just a self-aggrandizing exercise of avoidance.
The things I’ve learned from poring myself over this genre of books and podcasts is priceless. It’s helped me get so far and reach new levels of self-discovery.
</p>
<p>
  So this is kind of a break up letter that I’m writing to all self-help books and podcasts that I’ve used in the past six years.
</p>
<p>
  Sorry, self-help; it was me, not you.
</p>
<p>
  It’s time I actually apply everything I’ve learned to my real world relationships and problems.
</p>
<p>
  Everything I read now just repeats itself anyway. It all boils down to this:
</p>
<p>
  1. Take care of your body AND your mind. Together, they are one cohesive unit. But if one starts to slip, the whole machine will fall apart.
</p>
<p>
  2. Take responsibility for EVERYTHING in your life, even if it’s not your faut.
</p>
<p>
  3. Do shit. This is the most important one. Never stop doing.
</p>

<p>Thanks, self help.</p>
