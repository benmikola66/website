<p>
This is my piece of the internet.
</p>

<p>It's where I put all my writing that I want to last forever.</p>

<p>That's why I coded this myself. Companies like Twitter and Medium come and go,and take your writing with it. But this will always be here.</a></p>

<h2>Articles</h2>

<p>These are all the articles I wrote before I even thought I wanted to be a writer.</p>

<p>I wrote most of these in 2020 during the quarantine. I stopped because my main focus was learning copy.</p>

<p>But I'm going to start writing one article a week to get better.</p>

<p>I can't wait to see my progress over time.</p>
