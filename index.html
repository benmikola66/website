<p>
This is my piece of the internet.
</p>

<p>It's where I put all my writing that I want to last forever.</p>

<p>That's why I coded this myself. Companies like Twitter and Medium come and go, then take your writing with them. But this will always be here.</a></p>

<h2>Articles</h2>

<p>These are all the articles I wrote in 2019. I stopped for awhile.</p>

<p>I'll be posting the ones I've been working on soon. Luckily, my writing has improved lol.</>
