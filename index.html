This is my little part of the internet.
</p>

<p>All views and opinions written are subject to change and that's how I want it. Change is growth and if I'm not changing my mind about anything, then I'm not growing enough. </p>

<p>I like to write and this is where I put the stuff I want to last forever.</p> 

<p>It's for the stuff I want to remember and teach myself.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Right now my goal is to be a copywriter, so this site will be where I put everything I learn about marketing.</p>

Yes I have a Twitter and YouTube and Reddit and Medium. But those aren't permanent and they're not mine. This will be permanent and it's mine.

<h3>What matters to me right now</h3>
</p>
<p>
Spreading the word about psychedelic therapy, mental wellness, fixing my low back pain, and becoming a freelance copywriter.
