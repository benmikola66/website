  <h2>Improv</h2>

  <p>Improv is the only time I can think of when a group of adults all get in a room together once a week for three hours and play childish games that are so 
      goddamned funny they send you into the kind of fits of laughter that makes your abs sore the next day.</p>

    <p>Seriously, where else do adults do that? Nowhere. Not since you were a kid when you had recess. Improv is recess for grown-ups.</p> 
    
    <p>You might start out a little shy. But soon you realize nobody cares. They’re worried about themselves.</p>
    
    <p>When the first person has the guts to get silly, it disarms everyone and changes the vibe of the room. You instantly see everyone’s body language change. 
        The anxiety and unease escape the room. Everyone relaxes. You have permission to be silly. No more pressure to act normal. 
        Nothing matters except letting loose and enjoying the moment. No self-judgment.</p>
    
    <p>Everyone is on your side, rooting for you. You will never find an asshole in an improv class.
