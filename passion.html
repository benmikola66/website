<h2>Passion is stupid</h2>

<p>
  Passion is misunderstood. You’re not born with a passion. You have to find it by doing. <b>Action precedes passion.</b>
</p>
<p>
 Keep trying things and eventually you’ll find it. The guitarist doesn’t know he loves guitar until he picks up a guitar.
  </p>
  <p>
  Passion doesn’t mean you’re supposed to love every second of whatever the thing is either. <b>Passion is only found through suffering. It must be earned.</b> 
  The etymology of the word literally means “to endure” or “to suffer.” 
</p>

  <p>The more you do something, the more passionate you become. 
    Try a bunch of different stuff. If something piques your interest, even just a little bit, then keep at it.
    Learn and study it.
    You’ll uncover the intricacies most don’t know or care about. You’ll know something others don’t. 
    You’ll be able to do something others can’t. It’ll be a piece of you. Something nobody can steal.
    </p>
<p>
  Now, you’re passionate about it.
</p>


<p>
  I like 'rah-rah" motivation guys like Gary Vaynerchuck, but they can cause people to despise every dull moment in their lives. 
  People think that every moment is supposed to be a grind andd must serve a deeper purpose.
</p>
<p>
  It’s overwhelming to think of everything in terms of passion. It might make you ignore the little things that you like that you can cultivate into a passion.
</p>
<p>
  Just try things. Don’t worry too much.</p>
  
  <p>
  And if you don't even know where to start, ask yourself some questions.</p>
  
    <p>
How do you spend most of your time? What do you scour the Internet for? What do you think about that keeps you up at night? 
    What do you do that most people don’t? What do you care about that most people don’t?
</p>
  
  <p>Your passion is probably staring you in the face.</p>
