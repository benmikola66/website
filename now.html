<h2>What I'm doing now</h2>

<h3>Writing</h3>

<p>Everyday I write, for my job or for fun. I haven't gone a day without writing in three years.
  I don't really have any goals for my writing anymore. Maybe I will eventually. Now, I just write for the sake of writing.</p>

<h3>Reading</h3>

<p>I read to learn. Some of the smartest people in the world spend their lives learning about a subject, then they put it all down in a book. I'm so thankful for 
  that. I'd like to start reading more fiction.</p>
  
<h3>Learning</h3>

<p>I'm a curious person. I know very little. I want to soak up as much as I can. Other than books, I love watching YouTube videos and hounding smart people with questions 
  about everything I know nothing about. Lately, I'm most curious about world history and space.</p> 


<h3>Hobbies</h3>

<p>Lifting weights, yoga, hiking, guitar, writing, improv, and watching standup comedy. Always trying new things too.</p>
