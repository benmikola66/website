<h2>What I'm doing now</h2>

<h3>Copywriting</h3>

<p>Every day I study copywriting. Most of my time is spent finding small businesses that need better copy, rewriting their current copy, then sending it to them. My goal is to be a full time copywriter by the end of 2022. It's arbitrary, but deadlines work for me.</p>

<h3>Working my current full time job</h3>

<p>I spend fifty hours a week at my current (boring)job selling roofing supplies.</p>

<h3>Learning about mental health</h3>

<p>I'm curious about the old school ways of healing. Things like mushrooms, LSD, breathwork, MDMA, and yoga. All of those have helped me a lot. I think all of them are slowly making the world better, but most people don't know about them yet. It's important to me that I help spread the word about these medicines because I've never seen anything else improve people's lives so much. </p>

<h3>My hobbies</h3>

<p>Lifting weights, yoga, reading, writing, hiking, jiu jitsu, guitar, disc golf, and anything else that captures my interest. I'm down to try anything.</p>
