<h2>What I'm doing now</h2>

<h3>Copywriting and finding a copywriting job.</h3>

<p>Every day I study copywriting.</p>

<p> I find small businesses(currently gyms) that need better copy, rewrite it, then send it to them.</p>

<p>See my copy teardowns <a href="copy.html">here</a>.</p>

<p> My goal is to be a full time copywriter by the end of 2022, hopefully for Workrise. It's arbitrary, but deadlines work for me.</p>

<h3>Working my current full time job</h3>

<p>I spend fifty hours a week at my current (boring)job selling roofing supplies.</p>

<h3>Learning about mental health</h3>

<p>I'm curious about the old school ways of healing.</p> 

<p>Things like mushrooms, LSD, breathwork, MDMA, and yoga.</p>

<p> Each one has improved my mental health in a profound way. They are slowly making the world a better place, but most people don't know about them yet.</p>

<p>It's a duty of mine to share my story with these medicines.</p>

<h3>My hobbies</h3>

<p>Lifting weights, yoga, reading, writing, hiking, jiu jitsu, guitar, disc golf, and anything else that captures my interest. I'm down to try anything new.</p>
