<h2>Holotropic Breathwork</h2>

<p>
  After LSD became illegal in the late 1960s, Stinslav Grof, MD, who had been a proponent of the therapeutic effects of LSD, developed holotropic breathwork. The technique was created to achieve psychedelic-like states without using psychedelic drugs.
</p>
<p>
  From the Greek words, “holos” (whole) and “trepein” (to move toward), the word “holotropic” literally translates to “moving toward wholeness.”
</p>
<p>
  Holotropic breathwork helps you reach a state of wholeness without the use of unconventional medicines.
</p>
<p>
  It draws your mind into a non-ordinary state of consciousness that has incredible healing and transformative potential.
</p>
<p>
  This level of consciousness is induced only by using a controlled breathing process.
</p>
<p>
  The purpose is to obtain enlightenment of some kind, or to process trauma. The belief is that trauma will come forward during a session if it is necessary for healing.
</p>
<p>
  The body and mind know what they need to do. Each person’s experience with breathwork is unique, self-directed, and unfolds on its own as the practice progresses.
</p>
<p>
  It achieves similar effects of MDMA therapy.
</p>
<p>
  The primary principle of this technique is that healing comes from within the person practicing the breathwork. Everyone has a natural ability to heal themselves. You can use your breath to tap into this innate ability.
</p>
<p>
  Afterwards, a sense of groundedness washes over you.
</p>
<p>
  Some describe this experience as a more intense form of meditation.
</p>
<p>
  Holotropic breathwork affords you the ability to enter a non-ordinary state of consciousness normally associated with psychedelics, which can be appealing to people who feel stuck and unable to advance using other means, or for people who don’t have the ability to use other means.
